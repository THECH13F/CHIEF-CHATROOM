<br><br>
This is a Python-based multithreaded chat room that provides secure communication. It uses socket programming and threading to set up a server with a given IP address and port number which is ip 127.0.0.1 and port 8000, which clients can connect to. After connecting, users are prompted to enter a nickname, and then messages can be sent and broadcasted to all connected clients As wwell as they can send private messages also.

## Usage
1. We will have to start our Server first.
``` shell
Python Server.py
```
<b>Note: </b> Before running the server, make sure to edit the IP address and Port number. By default it is running on Localhost:8000 <br><br>
2. Run the Client file, to start the conversation. 
``` Shell
Python Client.py
```
<br>
3. Now Enter a nickname and start your chatting.
